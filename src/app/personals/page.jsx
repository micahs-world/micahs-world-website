      <h3>About Me</h3>

      <p>
        I'm a software engineer working primarily with Ruby and JavaScript.
        I have professional experience in start-ups and non-profits, where I
        develop and advocate for accessible, ethical, and pleasant software
        for the users and developers alike.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of software, I'm in a loving partnership with my best friend,
        Sean, and our two non-human kids, Ziggy and Hazel.
      </p>
